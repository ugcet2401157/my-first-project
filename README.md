This is a simple Number Guessing Game project. The computer randomly selects a number and the player has to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game gives hints like “too high” or “too low” after each guess. This project is designed for beginners to practice basic programming concepts such as loops, conditions ,and random numbers.
